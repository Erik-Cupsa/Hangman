  <h1> Rules: </h1>
  <h2> 
    In hangman, a random word is selected that you (the player) has to guess. You will try and guess the word by guessing potential letters that may be in the word. You have 6 lives and if you guess a letter wrong, you will lose a life. On your seventh wrong guess, you lose the game and have to restart. If you guess the word correctly before you lose all of your lives then you WIN! Good luck and happy guessing.
